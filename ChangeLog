2008-03-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: replaced the old obsolete chdebug.h debugging framework with our
    newly added debug framework so that we can get nfs_handler to a more
    stable build more quickly.

2008-02-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: added new Debug framework and converted some obsolete aunet_#?
    functions to their actual implementations. In addition, added more and
    more source files to our makefile to get the nfs handler compiled again.
    Lets hope the best for now until we see if it will build at all.

2008-02-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: now after more than 13 years of no development, the sources
    of ch_nfs are finally released under the GPL with the full permission
    of its initial author "Carsten Heyl". Also renamed the project to
    "aNFS" to make it easier to distinguish between the old AmiTCP
    based ch_nfs and the new general Amiga oriented NFS client. And
    hopefully we will be able to get the sources compiled quickly again
    so that development can continue and we may even move the NFS client
    forward to be compatible to NFSv3 or even NFSv4 in future. Let it
    roll! :)
